# scrum-presentation
This project contains a presentation made for a 6 hour (split up in 3 days) Scrum workshop given by me at [http://www.foundationu.com  Foundation University]'s [http://nightowl.foundationu.com Project Nightowl] and [http://entheosit.com/ Entheos IT].

The interactive version can be seen on http://dolfandringa.github.io/srum-presentation/index.html
