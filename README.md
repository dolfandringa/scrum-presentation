# scrum-presentation
This project contains a presentation made for a 6 hour (split up in 3 days) Scrum workshop given by me at [Foundation University](http://www.foundationu.com)'s [Project Nightowl](http://nightowl.foundationu.com) and [Entheos IT](http://entheosit.com/).

The interactive version can be seen on http://dolfandringa.github.io/scrum-presentation/index.html
